# Neighborhood App
## the final web development project for the Udacity Google Nanadegree "Frontend Web Development"

While I write this project, you will be able to find some good basketball courts in Hamburg. Give it a try and have a look on my progress. There will be a lot of learnings, that I will make and in the end, I will hopefully fit all of the PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS.

### Resources

=== Icons ===
* basketball icon by Fontawesome React Dependecny

### Installation

This Neighborhood App requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

$ npm install -d

```

### Techniques

I am using
