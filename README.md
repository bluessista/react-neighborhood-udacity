# Neighborhood App - Project 8
### the final web development project for the Udacity Google Nanadegree "Frontend Web Development"

While I write this project, you will be able to find some good basketball courts in Hamburg.

### Installation

This Neighborhood App requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd react-neighborhood-udacity
$ npm install -d
$ npm run start
```

Be aware, that the app is just jet build for development and needs to be run ```npm run build``` if you want to use the service worker.
